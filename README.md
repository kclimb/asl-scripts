## Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc  
By Smileyz

Last Status Update 4/16/2020:  
Load removal only, does not autosplit. There currently are not plans to add autosplitting functionality.

## Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls
By Smileyz

Last Status Update 4/16/2020:  
Load removal only, does not autosplit. There currently are not plans to add autosplitting functionality.

## Zero Escape: The Nonary Games  
By Smileyz and toburr

Last Status Update 4/16/2020:  
Pending approval for addition to LiveSplit.

Currently supports autosplitting for 999 Any%, 999 All Endings, all 999 Individual Endings runs, and 999 All Escapes, as well as Load Removal for all 999 categories. Support for VLR categories will be added eventually(tm).

Known Issues:
- Deleting a save file from the "Delete save data" option on the main menu of 999 will prevent the timer from automatically starting for 999 full-game runs. To resolve this, load any save file, then go back to the main menu (or just reboot the game). The game has not been friendly to us in our attempts to properly fix this issue, so we hope that these simple workarounds suffice.
- It has been reported that the autosplitter will not split sometimes after the Library or the Torture Room in 999 full game runs. We have attempted to replicate this issue but have not been able to do so successfully.

## Secrets Can Kill (original, not the remastered version)  
By toburr

Last Status Update: 4/16/2020:  
Complete, but this version is NOT the one available in LiveSplit. That would be evilclownattack's autosplitter, which you can find here: https://github.com/evilclownattack/autosplitters/blob/master/SCK.asl

~~I made this one anyway for personal use, and I might consider merging it with ECA's if he and other people want that, but I'm not prioritizing it.~~ As of March 2020 the contents of this autosplitter have been merged with evilclownattack's.

## Stay Tuned for Danger  
By toburr

Last Status Update 4/8/2019:  
Available in LiveSplit.

Any% and No-Save routes are fully tested, Glitchless isn't, but it's probably fine if No-Save is.

Issues have been reported with the Rick's tape split not working on Master difficulty. Haven't managed to replicate it though, so just be warned.
